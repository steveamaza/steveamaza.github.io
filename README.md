# Personal Website
Personal online resume for Stephen Amaza.

##Purpose
This will serve as my home and will be constantly updated as my skills in software development journey improve. Feel free to contribute minor changes, but I will rather not accept large rewrites - I know you people are badass out there, wait for me to catch up :blush:

I write pretty well though, so if you want to read my thoughts, head to [my Medium](https://medium.com/@steveamaza).

I have a goal to be the [top Ruby programmer in Nigeria](http://github-awards.com/users?utf8=%E2%9C%93&type=country&language=ruby&country=Nigeria) in 6 months, and I have made a compact timetable to show how I am going to attack that.

| Goal        | Date           | Programme  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Begin with Ruby      | 21 Sept 16 | MEST |
| Rails      | 31 Oct 16      |   MEST |
| Contribute to open source projects | 15 Nov 16      |    Personal |
| Host open source project | 25 Dec 16      |    Personal |

Why I am doing this weird ass README.md file is because,
* I am weird and awesome
* I want to put this publicly so I will be held accountable, and more importantly
* IT IS PART OF MY ASSIGNMENT :grin:
